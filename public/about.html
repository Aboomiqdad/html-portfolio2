<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Ogunwale Fawas Abiodun, A native of Ibdanland in Oyo State of Nigeria.</p>
<p>I did my undergraduate studies in Ekiti State University, Ado-Ekiti, Ekiti State, where I studied Human Anatomy, 
  but my interest in programming started specifically at the field of Web development ever since I started doing a
   telecommunication business whereby I saw different website with different features such as html and css with 
   different strategies and design but the same result which is to serve their customers best and this make the world of programming interesting.  </p>
<p>I am a researcher in the field of health science who recently published a paper immediately after my graduation fromt he university, in 
  that research work I addressed and investigated the roles of gut microbiome in the progression of neurodegerative disease.</p>

<p>I love to worship my God(Allah), I love to make new and good friend. This is short things I can say about me, if you need any specify 
  things about me, then you can contact me. </p>
